Hello, all.

Thank you for registering a date for the {{program.dinner_name}} Program! In order to be reimbursed, please:

1) Print a copy of this email with {{guest_name}}'s signature
2) Print a copy of the attached PDF form, and fill it out
3) Attach the above to an original, itemized, English receipt and
   proof of payment from the restaurant. Please note that we will not
   be able to reimburse you without both an itemized receipt and proof
   of payment. Sometimes these are provided as two separate documents.
4) Please turn this email, the reimbursement form, and the receipt(s)
   into the mailbox outside the UA office, W20-401.

By MIT policy, we cannot reimburse alcohol or tax. To avoid paying tax, tell the restaurant that your dinner should be tax-exempt, and show them a copy of MIT's tax-exemption letter (https://vpf.mit.edu/site/content/download/1812/6428/file/taxexempt_st2.pdf).

Thanks a lot for your participation and we hope you enjoy the program. As a reminder, you have ${{amount}} to spend on the dinner.

Best,
{{program.sponsor_long}}
