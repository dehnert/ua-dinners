Hi, {{guest.display_name}}.

Greetings from the {{program.sponsor_long}}. Thank you for agreeing to participate in the {{program.dinner_name}} Program. This email is to let you know, even though the students have talked to you about this already, that they've registered with us and have secured funding. We've listed your students below, for your reference.
{% for student in dinner.get_students %}
* {{student.display_name}}{% endfor %}

In terms of next steps, together you and your students will find a time that works for everyone. Actually, this process is entirely driven by your students and we are just happy to reimburse the cost.

We thank you for your participation and hope you enjoy it. If you have any questions, please do not hesitate to email us at <{{program.contact_addr}}>.

Respectfully yours,
