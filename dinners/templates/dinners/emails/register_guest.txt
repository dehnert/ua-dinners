Hi, {{guest.display_name}}.

Greetings from UA Student Committee on Education Policy (SCEP). Thank
you for agreeing to participate in the Student-Faculty Dinner
Program. This email is to let you know, even though the students have
talked to you about this already, that they've registered with us and
have secured funding. We've listed your students below, for your reference.
{% for student in dinner.students.all %}
* {{student.display_name}}{% endfor %}

In terms of next steps, together you and your students will find a time
that works for everyone. Actually, this process is entirely driven by
your students and SCEP is just happy to reimburse the cost.

This program aims to foster better relations between students and
members of the faculty, by providing an opportunity for informal
dialog. We thank you for your participation and hope you enjoy it. If
you have any questions, please do not hesitate to email us at
<ua-scep-dinners@mit.edu>.

Respectfully yours,

Undergraduate Association Student Committee on Educational Policy (SCEP)
