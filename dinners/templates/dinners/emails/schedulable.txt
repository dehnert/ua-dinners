Hello,

Thank you for participating in the {{program.dinner_name}}! All of the dinner attendees have now confirmed that they will be attending.  This e-mail is a confirmation that your application has been processed and also a reminder that you have until {{dinner.schedule_deadline|date:"DATE_FORMAT"}} to set up a date that is acceptable for all participants of the dinner. Please note that you only have to register your date by {{dinner.schedule_deadline|date:"DATE_FORMAT"}}.  The dinner can take place anytime until {{program.dinners_deadline|date:"DATE_FORMAT"}}. After picking a date please return to the UA website to enter the date that you have chosen:

In order to be reimbursed, you will need to turn in your original, itemized, receipt and proof of payment, attached to the confirmation email you will receive when you register a date with us.  The receipts will go into the mailbox outside the UA office, W20-401. The receipt must be itemized in English in order to be reimbursed.

By MIT policy, we cannot reimburse alcohol or tax. To avoid paying tax, tell the restaurant that your dinner should be tax-exempt, and show them a copy of MIT's tax-exemption letter (https://vpf.mit.edu/site/content/download/1812/6428/file/taxexempt_st2.pdf).

If you have any questions, please do not hesitate to email us at <{{program.contact_addr}}>.

Best,
{{program.sponsor_long}}
